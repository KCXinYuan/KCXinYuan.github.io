The Best Guessing Game in the Entire World
Kevin Chuang

Super "pear" programmers:

Driver fruit: Tomi Inouye
Navigator fruit: Kevin Chuang

This code is the best code in the world. It utilizes both HTML and JavaScript to create a super awesome guessing game about none other than me, the programmer! Multiple questions will trick and stump the user while teaching them a thing or two about me, myself, and I.

This code has a metric butt ton of features like:

-How does this code know my name?!? This code stores your responses with prompts and gives responses in alerts to immerse you in a full on personalized experience like none other!

-Looking for those sweet if/else if/else statements? This code is choc full of them!

if(user === "happy"){                 ****Do not run this code, it does absolutely nothing.

alert("Mission Accomplished!");
execute(Sweetfanfare.exe);
}

else{
alert("You're in the wrong neighborhood, my friend");
}

-Keeping track of scores has never been easier with functions that keep track of how many questions answered correctly!

-Updated weekly! It's like getting DLC for the low low price of F-F-F-F-F-F-Freeeee!

Coming soon: Loops! It's like Fruit Loops but way better (#pleaseDon'tSueMeForCopyrightInfringment).
Hit that enter key too quickly? Got the answer wrong? The code won't let you go until you do
what it says. Muahahahaha!
